# Music Player

Welcome to my independent music player project! This is a custom-built music player designed to be deployed as a desktop application using ElectronJS. The aim is to create a lightweight, efficient, and visually appealing player tailored to my personal preferences.

## How to Run the Project

1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd music-player
   ```
2. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the application:
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```
